	<h1>Paris</h1>
	<p>Paris (French: [paʁi] ( listen)) is the capital and the most populous city of France. 
	   It has an area of 105 square kilometres (41 square miles) and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within the 
	   administrative limits.[4] The city is both a commune and department, and forms the centre and headquarters 
	   of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an area of 12,012 square kilometres (4,638 square miles) 
	   and a population in 2014 of 12,005,077, comprising 18.2 percent of the population of France.[5]</p>

	   <p>The agglomeration has grown well beyond the city's administrative limits. <i lang="non">The Paris unité urbaine,</i> is a measure 
	   of continuous urban area for statistical purposes, including both the commune and its suburbs, and has a population
	   of 10,601,122 (Jan. 2013 census) which makes it the largest in the European Union.[2] The aire urbaine de Paris, 
	   a measure of metropolitan area, spans most of the Île-de-France region and has a population of 12,405,426 
	   (Jan. 2013 census),[6] constituting one-fifth of the population of France.[7] The Metropole of Grand Paris 
	   was created in 2016, combining the commune and its nearest suburbs into a single area for economic and 
	   environmental co-operation. Grand Paris covers 814 square kilometres (314 square miles) and has a population 
	   of 6.945 million persons.[8]</p>

	   <p><i lang="ang">Paris was founded in the 3rd century BC</i> by a Celtic people called the Parisii, who gave the city its name. 
	   By the 12th century, it was the largest city in the western world, a prosperous trading centre, and the home 
	   of the University of Paris, one of the oldest universities in history. By the 17th century Paris was one of 
	   Europe's major centres of finance, commerce, fashion, science, and the arts, and it retains that position still 
	   today.</p>

	   <p>The Paris Region had a GDP of €624 billion (US $687 billion) in 2012, accounting for 30.0 percent of the GDP 
	   of France, and ranking it as one of the wealthiest regions in Europe; it is the banking and financial centre 
	   of France, and contains the headquarters of 29 of the 31 French companies ranked in the 2015 Fortune Global 500.
	   <i lang="la">The city is also a major rail, highway, and air-transport hub</i>, served by the two international airports 
	   Paris-Charles de Gaulle (the second busiest airport in Europe after London Heathrow Airport with 63.8 million 
	   passengers in 2014) and Paris-Orly. Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million
	   passengers daily.[9] It is the second busiest metro system in Europe after Moscow Metro. Paris is the hub of the 
	   national road network, and is surrounded by three orbital roads: the Périphérique, the A86 motorway, and the 
	   Francilienne motorway.</p>

	<p>Among Paris's important museums and cultural institutions are the most visited art museum in the world, 
	   the <strong>Louvre</strong>, as well as the Musée d'Orsay, noted for its collection of French Impressionist art, and the 
	   Musée National d'Art Moderne in the Pompidou Centre, the largest collection of modern and contemporary art 
	   in Europe. The central area of the city along the Seine River is classified as a UNESCO Heritage Site, 
	   and includes many notable monuments, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris">Notre Dame
